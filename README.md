# CS121final

This is the final project for CS 121 for Travis Xiang and Rohan Iyer. 
This project helps for "Team of the Year" (TOTY) for professional soccer players. These data is taken from Fifa 20, but the people are actually professional soccer players. Our dataset came from Kaggle, namely the dataset at this link:

https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv

where we used players_20.csv. 

TODO: Include instructions for loading your data from the command-line in MySQL

TODO: Include instruction for running your Python program (e.g. if command-line arguments are supported, indicate what those are)

TODO: If there are any unfinished features, indicate this in your README so that we know some incomplete functionality is intended to prevent possible deductions (assuming you follow the rest of the requirements)
