This is the final project for CS 121 for Travis Xiang and Rohan Iyer. 
This project helps for "Team of the Year" (TOTY) for professional soccer players. These data is taken from Fifa 20, but the people are actually professional soccer players. Our dataset came from Kaggle, namely the dataset at this link:

https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv

where we used players_20.csv. 

To load the data from the command line, run MySql from the command line. Then, run "source setup.sql" followed by "load-data.sql". This will load the data into the command line. Then, run "source setup-passwords.sql", "source setup-routines.sql", "grant-permisisons.sql", and "source queries.sql" to get the maximum functionality for the app.

To run the Python program, simply run "python3 app.py".
